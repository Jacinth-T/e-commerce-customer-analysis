# Project 05 — E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

A web-based data analytics dashboard that analyzes e-commerce customer behavior using **RFM segmentation**, **product analytics**, and **regional revenue mapping**. Built with Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Download the Dataset

Download the **UCI Online Retail Dataset** from:
- [UCI ML Repository — Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
- Direct download: [Online Retail.xlsx](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx)

Save the file as `data/online_retail.csv` (convert from .xlsx to .csv if needed, or the setup script handles .xlsx too).

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Setup (One-Time)

```bash
python setup.py
```

This script:
- Cleans the raw dataset (removes nulls, cancelled orders, invalid rows)
- Computes RFM scores and customer segments
- Generates product and regional summaries
- Stores everything in a SQLite database at `db/ecommerce.db`

### 4. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to view the dashboard.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **RFM Analysis** is a powerful customer segmentation technique that uses three behavioral metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to group customers into actionable segments like "Champions" and "At Risk."
- **SQL aggregation** with SQLite provides a lightweight but effective way to store and query processed data without needing a full database server.
- **Streamlit + Plotly** make it straightforward to build interactive, professional-looking dashboards entirely in Python — no HTML/CSS/JS knowledge required.
- Data cleaning is often the most time-consuming part of any analytics project — handling nulls, cancelled orders, and type conversions took significant effort but dramatically improved data quality.
